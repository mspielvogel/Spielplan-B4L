# Spielplan-B4L

## Idea
1. Parameters are set in a config
2. Team names are listed in an .csv sheet with their corresponding strength
3. .csv sheet is loaded and groups and gameplan is created and saved
4. another .csv sheet is created where the results have to be written in
5. this sheet is again loaded and the group tables are updated and uploaded (the uploading process is done automatically)
6. the gameplan of the finals will be created after every game has an entry and this plan is saved as well
7. the results of the finals are entered and sequentially uploaded; the gameplan gets updated after every round
